Defines the colors for the whole app.  
Included in the `theme-provider` component.

```tsx
import { primaryPalette } from "@watheia/app.theme.accent-color"

function ApplicationContext({ children }) {
  return <div className={primaryPalette}>{children}</div>
}
```

We have a couple of main groups:

- texts color
- accent color (the 'primary', intent color).  
  You can override it with the `accent-color` component.
- backgrounds
- ~~errors~~ (prefer to use accent 'error' instead)

SCSS variable decleration for the basic colors used in our palette.  
This is only meant for building css-variables, consider using the `color-definitions` component instead.

Colors divide into these groups:

- Primary, brand (purple)
- Secondary (blue)
- Complementary (pink)
- Success (green)
- Risk (yellow)
- Danger (red)
- Neutrals (gray)
- Shadows

Each color has its own shades, scaling between 0 (lightest) and 100 (darkest),
e.g.: p20 (lightest purple), p30, p50 (base purple), p60 (highlight) p70 (darkest)
